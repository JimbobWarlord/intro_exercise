    <p>Hi, my name is James</p>
    <p>
      I started studying digital media because I have interests in UX/UI design,
      graphic design & editing
    </p>
    <p>I spend a lot of time with video games</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, I don't use emojis</p>
    <p>My favourite band is Queen and I can also play the guitar</p>
    <p>I have slight prior experience working with code in Interactive Media</p>
